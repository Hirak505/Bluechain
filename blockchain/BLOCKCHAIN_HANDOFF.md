Returns the complete project information.

---

#### `isProjectApproved(uint256 projectId)`

Returns whether the project has been approved.

---

#### `isMRVApproved(uint256 projectId)`

Returns whether the MRV report has been approved.

---

#### `getProjectCID(uint256 projectId)`

## 9. Contract Events

The contract emits the following events:

- `ProjectRegistered`
- `ProjectApproved`
- `MRVUploaded`
- `MRVApproved`
- `CreditsMinted`
- `CreditsTransferred`
- `CreditsRetired`
- `VerifierChanged`

These events can be used by the backend to build transaction history and by the frontend to display project/credit activity.

## 10. Frontend Integration

Frontend needs:

- Contract address
- `CarbonLedgerABI.json`
- Polygon Amoy network
- Chain ID: `80002`

The frontend can use the contract to display:

- Project information
- Approval status
- MRV status
- Project Report CID
- MRV CID
- Minted credits
- Available credits
- Retired credits

Wallet interactions should be signed through MetaMask or another supported wallet.

---

## 11. Backend Integration

Backend needs:

- Contract address
- `CarbonLedgerABI.json`
- Polygon Amoy RPC endpoint
- Appropriate wallet/signer configuration

The backend must obtain its RPC/API credentials and private signing key through environment variables.

**Never commit private keys or API keys to GitHub.**

---

## 12. IPFS Documents

### Project Report

CID:

`bafkreid43ylrdbixgfja2xwusbw44vi6itk6pe4tl3snznjubemweyb7ne`

### MRV Report

CID:

`bafkreig5mhmjg7cntgtx6haqefngcwqwfc7hmwoisg76vmceu46nf3jmaa`

These CIDs are stored on-chain as references to the corresponding documents.

---

## 13. Security

The following must never be committed to Git:

- `.env`
- Private keys
- API keys
- RPC credentials containing secrets

The `.gitignore` already excludes `.env`, `node_modules`, `artifacts`, and `cache`.

---

## 14. Repository

Blockchain implementation branch:

`feature/blockchain-wallet`

Blockchain commit:

`4f84b56`

Repository:

`https://github.com/Hirak505/Bluechain`

---

## 15. Current Status

**Blockchain implementation:** Complete

**Local testing:** Complete

**Polygon Amoy testing:** Complete

**Frontend/backend integration:** Pending

**Production deployment:** Not applicable yet. Current deployment is on Polygon Amoy Testnet.
